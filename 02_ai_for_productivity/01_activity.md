Digital Technologies for SDGs, Sustainable Business Practices, Gaps, and Future Directions

This research systematically explores the intersection of digital technologies, industry sectors, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), analyzing 1098 Sustainable Business Practices (SBPs) from 578 papers. It identifies 11 digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), geospatial technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and 3D printing, which are pivotal in addressing SDGs across 17 industries. AI and geospatial technologies dominate, contributing significantly to SDGs 7 (Clean Energy), 12 (Responsible Consumption), and 13 (Climate Action). For instance, AI optimizes energy grids, while geospatial technologies improve agricultural productivity through soil mapping and crop monitoring.

Sustainable Business Practices (SBPs):
SBPs leverage digital technologies to enhance sustainability in various sectors. In agriculture, geospatial technologies enable resource efficiency, while IoT sensors optimize industrial processes to reduce waste. Blockchain ensures transparency in supply chains, and 3D printing minimizes material usage in manufacturing. However, industries like financial services, ICT, and retail show minimal adoption of these technologies for sustainability.

Gaps Identified:
Although digital technologies are extensively applied in primary and secondary sectors, their adoption in tertiary industries and for certain SDGs (e.g., 1—No Poverty, 5—Gender Equality, and 16—Peace & Justice) remains limited. Technologies like immersive environments and proximity sensors are underutilized, and many applications are still in early development stages. The fragmented literature lacks a comprehensive view of the triple nexus: "digital technologies—sectors—SDGs."

Future Directions:
The study calls for a deeper exploration of underutilized technologies, such as immersive environments and robotics, and their potential for achieving less-addressed SDGs. It emphasizes the need for cross-sectoral studies to examine the scalability of SBPs and the integration of multiple digital technologies. Policymakers and managers are encouraged to allocate resources strategically to foster innovation and address sustainability challenges. Future research should also investigate the barriers and technical challenges of integrating these technologies and expand the analysis to include additional scientific databases.

Digital Technologies for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Key Insights and Future Directions

This study reviews how digital technologies support SDGs by analyzing 1098 examples of Sustainable Business Practices (SBPs) across 17 industries. It highlights 11 key technologies, including AI, IoT, blockchain, geospatial tools, and 3D printing. Among these, AI and geospatial tools stand out for their impact on clean energy, responsible consumption, and climate action. For example, AI improves energy efficiency, while geospatial tools enhance farming through better soil and crop monitoring.

Sustainable Business Practices (SBPs):
Digital technologies help industries become more sustainable. Geospatial tools boost agricultural efficiency, IoT reduces industrial waste, blockchain improves supply chain transparency, and 3D printing cuts material use. However, some industries, like retail and financial services, use these technologies less for sustainability.

Gaps Identified:
Digital technologies are mainly used in agriculture and manufacturing but are less common in sectors like retail and services. Some SDGs, such as eliminating poverty and promoting gender equality, receive less attention. Additionally, technologies like robotics and virtual environments are underused.

Future Directions:
The study suggests exploring underutilized technologies and focusing on less-addressed SDGs. It calls for more cross-industry research to scale up sustainable practices and integrate multiple digital tools. Policymakers should invest in innovation and address barriers to adopting these technologies.

How AI is Helping in Achieving Sustainability

Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a significant role in advancing sustainability by optimizing processes, reducing waste, and improving resource efficiency across various sectors. Below are key areas where AI is making a difference, supported by examples and quotes:

1. Energy Efficiency and Climate Action
AI contributes to SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action) by enhancing energy systems. For example:

Energy Grids Optimization: AI algorithms manage energy grids more efficiently, reducing energy loss and promoting renewable energy integration.
Quote: "AI optimizes energy grids, enabling better management of renewable energy sources and reducing overall energy wastage."
2. Agriculture and Food Security
AI supports SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) by improving agricultural productivity through precision farming:

Soil and Crop Monitoring: AI-powered geospatial tools analyze soil quality and monitor crop health, enabling farmers to make data-driven decisions.
Quote: "Geospatial technologies, powered by AI, improve agricultural productivity by providing detailed soil and crop monitoring."
3. Industrial Optimization and Waste Reduction
AI aids in achieving SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by minimizing waste in industries:

Smart Sensors: IoT devices powered by AI optimize industrial processes, reducing material and energy waste.
Quote: "IoT sensors, combined with AI, help industries cut waste and enhance process efficiency."
4. Supply Chain Transparency
AI enhances SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) by improving transparency in supply chains:

Blockchain and AI Synergy: AI analyzes supply chain data to identify inefficiencies and ensure ethical sourcing.
Quote: "Blockchain and AI together ensure transparency and accountability in supply chains."
5. Urban Sustainability
AI contributes to smart city initiatives, aligning with SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities):

Urban Planning: AI analyzes traffic patterns and energy usage, helping cities reduce congestion and energy consumption.
Quote: "AI-driven data analytics optimize urban planning, reducing resource consumption and improving liveability."
Gaps and Future Potential
While AI shows immense promise, its adoption in certain sectors like retail and financial services remains limited. Moreover, AI's application in addressing SDGs such as poverty reduction and gender equality is still underexplored. Future research and investments should focus on these gaps to fully harness AI's potential for sustainability.

By integrating AI into diverse sectors, we can significantly accelerate progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
