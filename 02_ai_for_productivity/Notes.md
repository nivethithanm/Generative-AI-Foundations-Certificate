# AI for content creation

Creating blog posts

Chain Prompting for Better Output: Instead of asking ChatGPT to do everything in one go, break it into steps (chain prompting).

Step 1 – Idea Generation
- Act as an experienced content strategist. Suggest 10 engaging blog post titles about “AI for small business,” optimized for SEO, each under 60 characters.

Step 2 – Outline Creation
- Take the title “AI Tools Every Small Business Should Try” and create a detailed blog outline with headings, subheadings, and bullet points.

Step 3 – Draft Writing
- Using the outline above, write the first draft of the blog post (~1200 words). Keep the tone friendly and conversational, and make sure each section includes an example.

Step 4 – Optimization
- Rewrite the draft with shorter sentences, better flow, and stronger SEO keywords.


Few-Shot Learning Example for Style Control: Few-shot learning means you give ChatGPT examples of what you want before asking it to generate new content.

Prompt:
<blockquote>
Here are two examples of my blog writing style:

Example 1:
“AI isn’t just for Silicon Valley tech bros — it’s becoming the secret weapon for mom-and-pop stores too. From automating invoices to predicting customer needs, AI is quietly revolutionizing small business life.”

Example 2:
“Think of AI as your tireless intern: it never sleeps, it learns fast, and it doesn’t spill coffee on your desk. Whether it’s answering customer queries or crunching sales numbers, AI’s making big business tricks available to everyone.”

Now, write an intro paragraph for a blog titled “How AI Can Save You Hours Every Week” in the same style as these examples.
