# SOLVE framework

- Situation: Describes the current state and specific problem factually (e.g., "Sales are down 10% this quarter").
- Obstacles: Identifies challenges blocking the goal (e.g., "Competitor launched a new product").
- Limitations: Outlines constraints like budget or time (e.g., "Limited marketing budget").
- Vision: Sets a specific, measurable desired outcome (e.g., "Increase sales by 15% next quarter").
- Expectations: Lists key requirements to consider the problem solved (e.g., "Identify sales decline cause").

Example Prompt:
<blockquote>
Situation: Team productivity has dropped by 15% over the last quarter, with remote employees reporting difficulties in collaboration and focus during virtual meetings.
Obstacles: Lack of clear communication tools, distractions from home environments, and inconsistent time zone coordination are hindering effective workflow.
Limitations: Budget is capped at $5,000 for new tools, and solutions must be implemented within one month without requiring extensive training.
Vision: Achieve a 20% increase in productivity metrics (e.g., task completion rate) within the next quarter, fostering better remote collaboration.
Expectations: Address root causes of distractions, ensure all team members feel supported, and measure success through pre- and post-implementation surveys.

# AI for Brainstorming

- Problem Analysis Prompts: Use AI for root cause (5 Whys), reframing (perspectives), data gathering, assumption identification, and stakeholder impact to deepen understanding (e.g., "Identify root causes via 5 Whys on SOLVE statement").
- Brainstorming Prompts: Generate solutions via general/role-based ideas, few-shot examples, constraints, unconventional approaches, analogies, or reverse thinking (e.g., "Generate solutions inspired by nature for SOLVE problem").
- Solution Evaluation Prompts: Assess via pros/cons, matrices (weighted criteria), risk mitigation, pre-mortem failure analysis, ROI estimation, and stakeholder impacts (e.g., "Create evaluation matrix for solutions based on SOLVE").
- Troubleshooting and Principles: Address vague/hallucinated responses by refining prompts; key tips include SOLVE first, iterate, combine techniques, document steps, and rely on human judgment for ethics and validation.

# Using Claude for Interactive reports

Data Visualization:
- Claude can analyze datasets and generate interactive dashboards without extensive prompting.
- Example: Analyzing an online module rating dataset to create comprehensive visualizations and insights.


Interactive HTML Visualizations:
- Claude can transform text-based case studies into interactive HTML visualizations.
- Example: Converting a case study on a health insurance company’s AI implementation into an interactive dashboard for easy understanding and sharing.


# Refining Prototypes with AI: Testing, Feedback & Iteration

- Concept & Wireframing: Use AI prompts to define feature value (e.g., "Describe core functionality for a news app feed"), create user personas (e.g., "Generate persona for busy professionals"), and develop text-based wireframes with iterations and alternative layouts for intuitive UI design.
- Visual Prototyping Guidance: Leverage AI for step-by-step instructions to create visual prototypes in tools like Figma (e.g., "Provide instructions for a basic screen link prototype"), design specific screens with platform conventions, and suggest prototyping tools based on criteria like ease of use.
- Basic Code Generation: Generate well-commented code snippets (e.g., "Create JavaScript for local storage") or pseudocode for functionality planning, noting that AI code requires review for security and best practices.
- Simulated User Feedback & Iteration: Simulate feedback from personas (e.g., "Provide feedback as a beginner user"), refine specific elements, conduct qualitative A/B testing, and plan real user testing with tasks and metrics.
- Beyond Software Prototyping: Extend AI to non-software projects like board game mechanics (e.g., "Suggest game mechanics for an educational topic") or e-learning module outlines, with tips to validate concepts, iterate, review code, and document ethically.


# Custom GPTs

- Define the objective & audience – Clearly identify the use case (e.g., customer support, content creation, tutoring) and the target users’ needs.
- Design the instructions & tone – Set system and style guidelines so the GPT responds in a specific personality, tone, and scope of knowledge.
- Upload or connect reference data – Provide custom knowledge (documents, FAQs, datasets) so it can give domain-specific answers beyond general training.
- Configure tools & capabilities – Decide if it can browse the web, generate images, run code, or integrate with APIs for extended functionality.
- Test & iterate – Conduct scenario-based testing, gather feedback, and refine prompts, instructions, and data until the responses match expectations.
