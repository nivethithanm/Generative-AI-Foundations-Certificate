# Activity 1: Problem Framer: Using the SOLVE Framework

Scenario


You are part of the Learning & Development (L&D) team at an EdTech company. Your company’s flagship online learning course is facing a 40% drop-off rate after the first module. Management has tasked you with identifying the root cause before proposing solutions.


Your goal is to define the problem clearly by considering:


✅ The current situation - What is happening? (Drop-off rate)

✅ Potential obstacles and limitations - What challenges might be causing this?

✅ Vision for improvement - What does success look like?

✅ Expectations for the AI’s output - How can AI assist in diagnosing and addressing the issue?



Goal


Use Productivity GPT to define a clear problem statement for the 40% learner drop-off rate, to be presented to the management.
